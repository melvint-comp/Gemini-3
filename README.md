# Kaizen Cloud Intrusion Detection System (KC-IDS)

    🛡️ AI-Powered Cloud Intrusion Detection with Continuous Learning

KC-IDS is a cloud-native, self-improving intrusion detection system built on **Google Cloud** and **Gemini 3**. It detects unauthorized cloud access by learning from real infrastructure data and improving indefinitely through an automated MLOps loop.

---

### 🚨 Problem Statement

Traditional cloud security tools generate alerts but lack:
- Cross-service reasoning
- Continuous learning
- High-level explanations

KC-IDS addresses this by combining **machine learning, reinforcement learning, and Gemini 3 reasoning** to detect and explain cloud intrusions.

**Definition of Fraud**
> Unauthorized access to the cloud value of a key which an identity does not own.
